            <h3>Orders</h3>
            <p class="music">
              All orders, including, online orders, telephone orders and preorders for limited availability products are
              not binding upon
              Guitar Center until we accept them. Unless otherwise agreed by Guitar Center, payment must be processed by
              Guitar Center prior
              to an order being accepted. Guitar Center will communicate its acceptance of an order by acknowledging
              your order by reply
              email then processing your payment and shipping the item(s) ordered to you or by processing your payment
              in-store and providing
              the item(s) ordered to you. We reserve the right to refuse to provide products or services to anyone.</p>

            <p class="music">Because prices, product descriptions and availability can change quickly, Guitar Center
              does not warrant the
              accuracy or completeness of the information provided on the Site, in our stores or in written materials
              and is not responsible
              for pricing, typographical or other errors.

              If a product you purchase does not match the description on the Site, as your sole and exclusive remedy
              you may return the product,
              unused, to Guitar Center and receive a refund of your purchase price.

              Items in your shopping cart will reflect the most recent price displayed on each item's product detail
              page. Prices are frequently
              updated to adjust for different sales, limited pricing, and other discounting. Therefore, prices on the
              product detail page and in
              your cart may change after such updates to reflect the current prices. Placing items in your cart does not
              reserve the current prices
              shown at that time. Prices are reserved only by placing an order.
